# PolishAlphabet_SignLanguage_Detection

 The project's goal is to train a multiclass classifier to recognize a user's hand motions while spelling letters in the Polish sign alphabet. The system will operate in a real-world setting, with the assumption that the user will be recorded with a computer camera and letters recognized in real-time. The system will deal with different users who are dressed differently and come from different backgrounds. The user's letters will be recognized and typed as words on the GUI text application. <br>
